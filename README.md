[faq]

How to block in Basketball Bros?
Stay between ball and rim, then jump late at the shooter's apex with L. Don't spam blockâ€”tiny delays improve timing windows and reduce fouls. Use verticality (hands up, minimal forward drift), and learn release cues for different players. After the contest, immediately box out; many blocks convert into easy secondâ€‘chance points if you don't secure the board.

Who made Basketball Bros?
It's developed and maintained by indie webâ€‘game creators who focus on responsive H5 play, quick loading, and lowâ€‘latency input. The project evolves through community feedbackâ€”balance passes and qualityâ€‘ofâ€‘life updates roll out over time.

Who is Zat Machine in Basketball Bros?
Zat Machine is a bruising power forward built for screens, putâ€‘backs, and paint control. He excels at sealing his man, rolling hard after picks, and finishing through contact (use G near the rim for powerful dunks). On defense, park him in drop coverage to wall off drives and vacuum rebounds. He's not a perimeter creator, so pair him with a shooter or slasher who benefits from his screens and gravity.
