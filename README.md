[about the Basketball Bros game]

🏀 Basketball Bros is a fast-paced, arcade-style browser basketball game designed for quick matches and highlight plays. It focuses on responsive controls, snappy animations, and pick‑up‑and‑play fun on both desktop and mobile devices.

Development background: indie web‑game project built to showcase modern H5 performance, accessibility, and cross‑device input.
Tech stack: HTML5, CSS (utility‑first), JavaScript; optimized for low input latency and stable 60FPS rendering.

Controls: Arrow keys / WASD for movement, jump, and crouch; G for shoot/dunk; L for block/steal.

Design: character archetypes (sharpshooters, slashers, defenders) encourage different playstyles and team synergy.
Audio & feedback: curated sound effects and crowd reactions to emphasize momentum swings and clutch plays.

Performance: lazy loading, resource preconnect, and lightweight UI ensure quick start and consistent play.

Compatibility: works in modern browsers; keyboard recommended on desktop, touch controls on mobile.

Basketball Bros aims to deliver the feel of streetball flair and arcade intensity in short, satisfying sessions—ideal for quick breaks or longer play streaks.

### How to block in Basketball Bros?

Stay between ball and rim, then jump late at the shooter's apex with L. Don't spam block—tiny delays improve timing windows and reduce fouls. Use verticality (hands up, minimal forward drift), and learn release cues for different players. After the contest, immediately box out; many blocks convert into easy second‑chance points if you don't secure the board.

### Who made Basketball Bros?

It's developed and maintained by indie web‑game creators who focus on responsive H5 play, quick loading, and low‑latency input. The project evolves through community feedback—balance passes and quality‑of‑life updates roll out over time.

### Who is Zat Machine in Basketball Bros?

Zat Machine is a bruising power forward built for screens, put‑backs, and paint control. He excels at sealing his man, rolling hard after picks, and finishing through contact (use G near the rim for powerful dunks). On defense, park him in drop coverage to wall off drives and vacuum rebounds. He's not a perimeter creator, so pair him with a shooter or slasher who benefits from his screens and gravity.
